### Conclusion

This paper discussed extending the test suite of a base package by increasing the test suite of dependent projects. 

This paper provided valuable guidance for improving test coverage. The authors proposed a detailed evaluation and provided statistical metrics of the results. 

In the discussion section, they explored areas for improvements, including achieving permanent enhancements and how to reduce execution time. 

However, the test suite in this paper was relatively small, covering only line and mutation tests. The conclusions still have some limitations.

### Interesting Points

The points in this article that interest me the most are:

1. How to generate new test suites, as mentioned in this paper regarding generating test suites for dependent projects.
2. Test amplification is a novel topic for me, and I'm also interested in it.
