### Introduction 

- Modern software applications are commonly built on top of many reusable packages that are constantly evolving.
- It may raise a risk of supply-chain attacks though malicious packages upadates.
- Many defenses against supply-chain attacks have been developed.
- The weaknesses of current approaches are lack of practical evaluations and have limitations to handle real vulnerabilities. 

### Contribution

(1) we design a lightweight permission system that protects Node.js applications against malicious package updates for a significant number of packages, 
(2) we discuss design trade-offs to highlight how the chosen partial but low-cost solution fits into a larger security strategy, 
(3) we evaluate the solution on a large number of packages and applications, 
(4) we make both the implementation and evaluation benchmarks available (https://github.com/gabrielcsf/malicious-updates-icse2021).


### Motivation





### Methodology




### Implementation




### Conclusion

- Discussions about the emerging security challenges of malicious package updates.

- Design of a permission system.

- Evaluation about the system, it shown that 31.9% of all packages can be protected at almost no cost.
